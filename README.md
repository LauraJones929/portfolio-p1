# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML / CSS
## **Jess Hynes Music - Live Site**
[View Live Site](https://laurajones929.github.io./portfolio-p1/)

## **Business Objectives**

For this project I have designed and created a genuine, static website for a professional, local singer. The website will be used to promote what she has to offer, as well as inform her potential clients/customers of the range of packages and entertainment that she provides.

The application is designed to be accessible to all users and responsive to all screen sizes, so that the targeted audience can easily navigate through the site and achieve what they set out to do.

The project's main purpose and focus is to ensure that I successfully complete my first milestone on the Code Institute course. I have used HTML and CSS only as I wanted to build on these skills first, before expanding my knowledge on Bootstrap or any other frameworks.

## Client's Requests

In order to create an informative platform, these are the key features that the client has requested:
- an 'About Me' section - this gives a detailed insight into who Jess Hynes is and what skills she possesses.
- media (images and videos) - these are displayed throughout the website. Embedded YouTube videos as well as background images to add the desired aesthetic. *Images/videos are credited and sourced throughout.*
- a list of packages - this informs potential clients/customers of Jess' packages that she has to offer.
- a contact form - to allow potential clients/customers to get in touch with any enquiries that they may have. *As this project is HTML/CSS focused, the form is static until I have aquired further skills in order to be able to script in the necessary attributes and coding to send form input to a specific destination.*
- social media links available at all times throughout site - this allows users to access Jess' social platforms if desired.

## **User Experience (UX)**
### User Stories
- **First Time Visitor Goals**
  - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to quickly navigate through the site and see what style and aesthetic Jess brings as I'm interested in booking her for my wedding. I also want to easily locate her social media links.

- **Returning Visitor Goals**
  - As a returning visitor, I want to find contact information to enquire about prices and availability.

- **Frequent Visitor Goals**
  - As a frequent visitor, I want to see if there are any new packages available for cooperate events.

### Design
- **Colour Scheme**
  
  - The main colour scheme is neutral and light, in order to highlight any darker text. As photographic images are used throughout the site, neutral colours will not take away any attention from the images that are put in place for promotional and decorative purposes.
  - For backgrounds (body/header/footer) I have chosen to use white and off-white, a very subtle difference which is easy on the eyes for users. When looking back at any strategy planning regarding this project, the users are looking to potentially book the client to perform at an event, whether it is a wedding, a festival or a store opening, however most of her bookings do come from weddings, therefore I thought it was more appropriate to use softer colours, as opposed to bright and bold or too contrasting.
  - For any element background, including paragraphs, contact form and the contact icon, I have used a faint, low-key green that ties in nicely with the white tones. Green is known for its ability to induce calming and relaxing emotions which I think suits the style of music that the client has to offer, as well as creating a positive emotional response for users.
  - The text throughout the site is a very dark grey as I thought black would be too contrasting and take away the soft, subtleness that I was aiming for.
  
- **Typography**

  - Fonts are imported into the CSS file via Google Fonts.
  - To keep the website looking clean and neutral, a selection of 3 fonts is used throughout the website, 2 of which have a very similar look and feel.
  - For the main heading which is the artists name, I have chosen to use the font family of 'Parisienne', with a fallback font of 'Cursive', in the event of the preferred font failing to import. This font will hopefully create a positive user experience when first entering the site as it exudes a professional yet warm mood.
  - For sub-headings which includes the navigation menu, along with sub-titles across the page/s, I have chosen to use the font family of 'Raleway' as it stands clean and clear, making a statement but not enough to draw attention away from more important features on the page. In the event of this font failing, I have set the fallback font to 'Sans-serif'.
  - For general text I have chosen the font family of 'Inter'. Again this is a clean and clear font that is easy to read, and maintains the neutral tone flowing throughout the site. Fallback font set to 'Sans-serif'.

- **Imagery**

  - Photographic imagery is used throughout the site. Background imaging is used across the page to give the user a well rounded look and feel of the clients' aesthetic and style. Images are used to capture the essense of the artist and the height of the entertainment that she brings. After consideration, 2 background images will be used so as to not overload the page with distractions, this will also encourage the user to access the clients' social media via the link icons.
  Each image is provided by the client and is taken from her social media accounts. These images are credited and sourced appropriately in the credit section of the README file and in comments above the relevant code.

  The header will be fixed to the top of the page when scrolling so the user can navigate between sections without having to scroll back to the top. The footer is also fixed so that the user is aware of social media links, the client has requested that social media links be available at all times.

  Videos that the client has recorded in her home studio have been embedded via iframe elements, sourced by YouTube. The videos respond to screen sizes so that they fill the screen width on smaller devices, and maintain an evenly spaced row on larger devices.

### Wireframes
Below are 3 links to show the initial drafts for each screen size. They show how I expect the responsivity between devices to go and how the structure of each page will look.

- [Mobile Wireframe](mobile-wf.md)
- [Tablet Wireframe](tablet-wf.md)
- [Desktop Wireframe](desktop-wf.md)

After initiating the project, I decided that I would no longer have separate pages on the website but instead I will have different sections that are clearly spaced and marked on one page. The user is able to navigate between sections via a fixed navigation menu. As there is not a great deal of text or content within each section, only what is needed, I thought this would be the best approach as separate pages would look too spacey or empty.

Some other changes that I made compared to the wireframe are as follows:
- The text on each page does not overlay the background image. The background images now have their own section as I felt the overlaying would look too busy, and would not match the desired effect of subtlety.
- The textbox in the contact form is now under the name and email address input area, rather than to the right side of them.
- I have embedded 3 iframe videos instead of 5, as I felt 3 looked more pleasing to the eye when in a row.
- The event services are in a list on a single line (2 lines on smaller screen sizes) rather than in separate paragraphs.
