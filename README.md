# Portfolio Project 1 - HTML / CSS
## **Jess Hynes Music - Live Site**
(live website link will go here)

## **Business Objectives**

For this project I have designed and created a genuine, static website for a professional, local singer. The website will be used to promote what she has to offer, as well as inform her potential clients/customers of the range of packages and entertainment that she provides.

The application is designed to be accessible to all users and responsive to all screen sizes, so that the targeted audience can easily navigate through the site and achieve what they set out to do.

The project's main purpose and focus is to ensure that I successfully complete my first milestone in the CI course.

## Client's Requests

In order to create an informative platform, these are the key features that the client has requested:
- an 'About Me' section - this gives a detailed insight into who Jess Hynes is and what skills she possesses.
- media (images and videos) - these are displayed throughout the website, as gallery style images as well as background images to add the desired aesthetic. *Images/videos are credited and sourced throughout.*
- a list of upcoming public gigs - this informs interested parties of where Jess' gigs are and when.
- sections/pages designated to different acts - Jess is part of 4 seperate acts, which have their own informative section or page within the website.
- a list of packages - this informs potential clients/customers of Jess' packages that she has to offer.
- a contact form - to allow potential clients/customers to get in touch with any enquiries that they may have. *As this project is HTML/CSS focused, the form is static until I have aquired further skills in order to be able to script in the necessary attributes and coding to send form input to a specific destination.*
- social media links - this allows users to access Jess' social platforms if desired.
