# User Stories Testing

## First Time Visitor Goals
*"As a first time visitor, I want to be able to quickly navigate through the site and see what style and aesthetic Jess brings as I'm interested in booking her for my wedding."*

*"As a business owner, I want to allow any potential clients to navigate through my site easily without getting lost or feeling overwhelmed as this could put people off and they may look elsewhere."*

- The navigation menu is visible and accessible at all times whilst scrolling, as the header is fixed to the top of the page. If the user wants to quickly be taken to the music section to view and watch Jess' music videos then this is doable with just one click.

- Users can watch Jess' YouTube videos directly from the website without having to leave the page, which will give the user a good insight into the sounds and vibes that Jess brings.

- There are welcoming and aesthetically pleasing background images catching the users' attention from the second they open the landing page. They will see that Jess brings a fun atmosphere to events and parties through her performance.

*"As a first time visitor, I want to be able to locate Jess' social media links."*

- Social media links are visible and accessible at all times whilst scrolling as the footer is fixed to the bottom of the page.

## Returning Visitor Goals
*"As a returning visitor, I want to be able to contact Jess to enquire about prices and availability."*

- There is a contact link in the nav bar that is accessible at all times in the fixed header, as well as a contact icon, that sits below the packages and events section half way down the page. This icon will take the user directly to the contact form when clicked.
- Once I have aquired the appropriate skills in order to link the form to the clients' inbox, the user will be able to send a message directly to Jess, along with providing their own name and email address.

*"As a first time visitor, I want to find a link to be able to listen to Jess on Spotify or YouTube."*

*"As a business owner, I want to provide social media links that are easy to spot and access."*

- Recognisable icons for social media platforms will take the user directly to Jess' relevant account when clicked. This is not yet set up and the icons are linked to the social platforms' homepage. This will be set up accordingly when the website has a genuine domain and is ready for the client to use.

- Icons are spaced evenly in the footer and are accessible at all times, due to a fixed footer at the bottom of the page.

## Frequent Visitor Goals
*"As a frequent visitor, I want to see if there are any new packages available for cooperate events."*

*"As a business owner, I want to update any new videos or package offers onto my website."*

- Users will be able to visit the page to keep up to date with any new wedding packages that are available.
- The client will be able to update packages or videos so that users are being encouraged to check out the site for new content.

*"As a business owner, I want to be able to receive any queries or messages from potential customers via email."*
- Currently the form is for HTML and CSS purposes only and only sends messages to the Code Institute form dump. Eventually, once I have aquired the appropriate skills to do so, the client will be able to receive messages from users directly into her email inbox.
